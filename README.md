# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

This course deals with the issues of defining intelligence and rationality in an agent, various methods of formalizing them, and models for representing and using knowledge. In specific topics, mainly search, logical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, and decision-making under uncertainty, the course will focus all the way down to the algorithm level, in order to provide some hands-on experience with programming artificially intelligent agents. We will also briefly examine the currently hot topic of meta-reasoning in search.

Introduction to Artificial Intelligence is an elective/advanced course for bachelors/masters computer science students in Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.
